TO RUN:
-------------------------------
source buildRun.sh 
or,
./builRun.sh

DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------
**** mat_dims_amped.py **** generates the matrix dimensions for a single layer of an LLM model -- the essential parameters need to be passed -- as of now it is a stand alone file -- we will connect it with AMPED once it is public

*** run.sh *** runs DeepFlow sequentially for every GEMM

*** cal_time.py *** takes into account the number of batches, number of layers and sums up the time for FW and BW passes. In addition to LLM
model specific parameters, it also needs the communication time from AMPED. As of now it is done manually -- we can connect it with AMPED for
auomation.

--------------------------------
NOTE
--------------------------------
The current strategy of GEMM break up wroks for Tensor model parallelism
Data or pipeline parallelism needs modifications
