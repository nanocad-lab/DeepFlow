        # How we arrived at the intra_node NVLINK 2.0 parameters:
        # For nominal freuqnecy which is actually bits/second, we found 50GB/s PER NVLINK.
        # However, each NVLINK is composed out of 32 WIRES (16 diff pairs, 8 per direction).
        # So, 50 / 32 = 1.56 GB/s
        # So 1.56 * 8 = 12.48 Gb/s PER NVLINK
        # For energy, we found 8pj/bit.
        # nominal_enery_per_link is ACTUALLY joules/byte per link.
        # THIS MEANS WE ARE TREATING LINKS IN THE CODE AS PHYSICAL WIRES.
        # then, for num_links_per_mm, we assume 815mm^2 V100 is square.
        # perimeter is then 114.2
        # 32 physical wires per NVlink, 6 NVlinks per chip, so 32*6 = 192 links per 114 mm^2
        # Then, we DOUBLE the number to account for perimeter fraction is 0.5

        # There is a major issue. The numbers calculated above are PER GPU.
        # We have 20 workers in the node, but the code assumes the numbers are PER NODE, not per GPU. However it asks for links per ONE GPUs perimeter. THis makes no sense.
